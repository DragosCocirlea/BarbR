## The app is composed of 5 Activities, one of which has 3 Fragments:

- Signin Activity
- Signup Activity
- Home Activity
  - My appoointments Fragment
  - Search barbershop Fragment
  - My profile Fragment
- Make appointment Activity
- Edit profile Activity

<br/>

## The app followed these guidelines:

- Written in Kotlin
- Has more than 3 screens
- Uses a custom library for navigation (we used it before, thus it was faster to implement)
- Downloads and uploads data to our custom backend hosted on AWS
- Uses RecyclerView
- Interacts with Google Maps (after creating an appointment, a button can be pressed on the "My Appointments" screen that places a pin on Google Maps at the barbershop location)
- Is publicly available on this repo
